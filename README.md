- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikitoss77
- 👀 I’m interested in the topic of developing voice assistants for the family.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying product management and working on the idea of creating a voice assistant for the family "Order from Mikhalych".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with people, who can share their experience in creating and integrating smart bots (voice, text, graphic) into messengers Wats App, Viber, Telegram, VK, FaceBook, etc., as well as integration with Siri, Alice, Salyut, Marusya, Oleg, Marvin, Google Assistant, Alexa, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me in telegram @Nukito or Nikitos77 on https://github.com.
